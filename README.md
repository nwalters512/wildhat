### Setup
This project requires the [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) library; make sure it is properly installed in your Arduino libraries folder before beginning.

By default, the data line is on digital out 10 and clock is on digital out 11. However, this can be changed by adjusting the apppropriate ```#define```s.
